# [Bytes The Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE)

Gem to convert text into binary (or binary into text).

## Background
I've really been appreciating not having to communicate with computers using 0's and 1's. Wanted to visualize the bytes behind everything I type.

Wanted deeper insight into how this conversion can be done using Ruby. 

Also saw Bohemian Rhapsody recently and really have Queen songs stuck in my head (hence the name of this repo)

## Installation

To install this gem, run:

```bash
gem install btd
```

## Run It
After this gem is installed, simply run `btd`, passing the text / binary you would like to convert as argument(s).

### Examples

```bash
$ btd shimmy shimmy ya
1110011 1101000 1101001 1101101 1101101 1111001 100000 1110011 1101000 1101001 1101101 1101101 1111001 100000 1111001 1100001
```

```bash
$ btd 1110011 1101000 1101001 1101101 1101101 1111001 100000 1110011 1101000 1101001 1101101 1101101 1111001 100000 1111001 1100001
shimmy shimmy ya
```
